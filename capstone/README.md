### Project name: 
Discord bot for on-chain transaction notification


### Brief Project Description:

I plan to build a discord bot to send updates about any changes/ transactions to
my wallet.
For example, currently after every transaction we make, we need to open solana
explorer and then look for the transaction we made if we want to verify if it actually
happened.
This project will reduce the need for a user to go on solana explorer everytime
they make a transaction and provide the update in their discord inbox. Also, I intend to add some interesting upgrade to the
idea,
1. Adding custom views based on different types of transactions.
For example, to filter out all Defi tx with Orca. or, to filter out NFT tx.
2. The categories of transaction to be created based on the memos.
3. Being able to notify you paid someone with a message as well.


### Why this project ?

As a beginner, when I was creating tokens or nfts, I felt the need to always go to
solana explorer to verify if the tokens were created on not and the transaction went
through or not. In a normal web2 app, we either receive an email or a text
message, whenever we make a transaction. Also, it was hard for me to
understand most of the information present on the solana explorer. So, I thought
why not make it simpler for a beginner and led to this idea.
